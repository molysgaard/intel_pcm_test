This is a test of the Intel PCM measurement.

You can list your events in the custom_events array.
The code will run the same kernel several with different PCM events. This way we can measure the more than 3 events in one binary. I am not sure if this will work for superpixels though.

If the PCM doesn't register try doing what the script tells you to fix the problems.
If that doesn't help try running it as sudo. If that fails try to run it with reset:

$ sudo ./test reset

and then run it as sudo again

$ sudo ./test
